# destiny2-junk-dismantler
AutoHotkey script to dismantle weapons and armour in Destiny 2.

This macro ignores equipped gear.

If there's anything you want to keep, take it out of your inventory and store it in your vault.

Make sure all junk items to be dismantled are unlocked (this can easily be done with Destiny Item Manager).

So far this only works on 1920 x 1080 resolution.

## *Vault weapons/armour that you want to keep!!!!*

All this macro does is automatically dismantle items in your inventory, rather than forcing you to sit and mindlessly hold the dismantle button.
As this is purely an accessibility feature, it does not violate ToS.

# Future Plans
- Play a sound when finished
- Implement controller support to allow for tabbed-out dismantling
- Implement support for higher resolutions
